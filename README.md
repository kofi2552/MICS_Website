Website Project management for MICS

TO START WORKING ON THIS PROJECT

1. Make sure you have git installed on your computer.
   Configure Git (if needed):
   If they haven't configured Git on their machine with their GitHub credentials, they may need to set up their username and email:

git config user.name "Your Github UserName"
git config user.email "your_github.email@example.com"

(Replace "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with their actual GitHub username and email.)

2. Using any code editor of your choice, open the terminal or command prompt
3. The first step is to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

git clone https://github.com/kofi2552/MICS_Website.git

(This command will create a local copy of the repository on their machine.)

4. After cloning, you need to navigate to the repository's directory on your local machine using the cd command:

cd MICS_Website

5. Switch to Your Assigned Branch:

- For example, if you are assigned to a branch named "branch_f1," you can switch to that branch like this:

git checkout branch_f1

(By replacing "branch_f1" with the actual name of the branch you've been assigned to.

THIS IS THE BRANCH CREATED FOR EVERYONE
Mr. Kunde Micheal = Dev_mk
Mr. Arhin Justice = Dev_ja
Mr. Cephas Dakwa = Dev_cd

6. Make Changes, Stage, Commit, and Push:
   Once you are on your assigned branch, you can

- Make changes to the code
  Make changes to files

- Stage the changes
  git add .

- Commit them
  git commit -m "Brief description of changes"

- Push the changes to the remote repository.
  git push origin (Your_Branch_Name_Here)

(Replace "Brief description of changes" with an appropriate commit message and "Your_Branch_Name_Here" with their actual branch name.)

7. Create Pull Request (PR):
   After pushing changes to your branch on GitHub, create a pull request from your branch to the main branch (master). You can do this directly on GitHub website by navigating to the repository, selecting their branch, and clicking on create pull request.
